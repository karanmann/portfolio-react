Karan Mann's portfolio

I have created this portfolio to gather all my front end projects in all place:
<!-- 
    the 20 applications I built during the 24 weeks of the Fall 2020 edition of the Technigo Remote Front End Boot Camp
    all applications created after the Boot Camp -->

The layout is based on the Technigo portfolio design made by Jenny Skogvoll at Makeable Sthlm.
The approach

I converted the basic portfolio I built during week 8 of the Technigo Front end Boot Camp to a React application by dividing it into smaller React components and entirely styling it with Styled Components ruled by a Theme Provided.

I used conditional rendering to keep non featured projects apart from the featured ones.

Responsiveness, compatibility and accessibility

The application has been developed with a mobile first approach and is fully responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.

The page has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari iOS and MacOS where it looks and behaves identically.

It works well for people using screen readers and keyboard navigation.
